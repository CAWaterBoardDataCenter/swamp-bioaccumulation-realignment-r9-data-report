# Introduction

The preservation, enhancement, and restoration of California\'s water resources is vital to the health and well-being of all Californians, California Native American Tribes (tribes), the economy, and the environment for present and future generations. When first established in 2006, the mission of the State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Water Boards) [Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring.html) (Program) was to provide statewide monitoring data and information that could be used to:

-   Assess and contribute to the protection and restoration of fishing and aquatic life beneficial uses that are impacted by the bioaccumulation of pollutants in California\'s waterbodies, and

-   Assess the human health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish in California\'s freshwater and coastal ecosystems, and use that information to support the development of advisories that would inform consumers of significant health risks associated with the consumption of particular species.

The Program has realized several successes, such as establishing comprehensive, statewide bioaccumulation monitoring methodologies and assessments that began to answer the question: "Is it safe to eat fish and shellfish from our waters?", and forming the [Safe to Eat Workgroup](https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/monitoring_council/bioaccumulation_oversight_group/index.html) (STEW; formerly Bioaccumulation Oversight Group \[BOG\]).

Program staff and STEW recognize that the original Program plans were ambitious given their limited resources, and that there are some discrepancies between the Program vision and its current design. While data have been generated and used to inform [fish consumption advisories](https://oehha.ca.gov/fish/advisories) throughout the state, significant data and information gaps remain regarding the question: \"Is it safe to eat fish and shellfish from our waters?\" Particularly important gaps exist for waterbodies or species that are important for subsistence by historically underrepresented communities, as well as Tribal tradition, culture, and subsistence. To address these gaps, the Program implemented a [Realignment process](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/program_realignment.html) within the boundaries of the [San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sandiego/) (San Diego Region) from 2021 - 2023.

A key component of the Program [Statewide Realignment Plan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/bioaccumulation_monitoring/bioaccumulation_program_realignment_20201211.pdf) involved conducting targeted sampling in 2022 according to the recommendations of the San Diego Region Realignment Advisory Committee (Committee). Monitoring and analysis priorities were discussed and set by Committee through a series of meetings and are described in the [Monitoring and Analysis Workplan for the San Diego Region Realignment](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/bioaccumulationprogram-realignment-monitoringanalysisworkplan-r9-20211216.pdf) (Dec 2021).

The monitoring and analysis was jointly funded and preformed by the Program and San Diego Region. A description of the monitoring that took place by the Program is provided in the [Cruise Report](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/2023/BioaccumulationProgram_Realignment_CruiseReport_R9_20230307.pdf) (Mar 2023). The San Diego Region also collected invertebrate samples, and a summary of those monitoring efforts will be described here.

This data report presents the methods and analytical results of tissue and water samples that were collected in May - October 2022; a total of ten locations were sampled (Figure 1).

![Figure 1. San Diego Region Realignment sampling locations. Blue dots indicate locations that were sampled; red dots indicate sites that were discussed by the Committee but that we could not prioritize for monitoring due to resource limitations.](figures/Figure1.jpg){width="7in"}

This data report will briefly summarize monitoring and analysis methods and provide a more thorough summary analysis results by sampling location.

# Methods

A detailed description of the methods for sample collection and chemical analysis is provided in the [Monitoring and Analysis Workplan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/bioaccumulationprogram-realignment-monitoringanalysisworkplan-r9-20211216.pdf) (Dec 2021). Sample collection methods employed during monitoring are also described in the [Cruise Report](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/2023/BioaccumulationProgram_Realignment_CruiseReport_R9_20230307.pdf) (Mar 2023). These sampling and analysis methods are briefly summarized here.

## Sample Collection

The sampling crews were able to successfully collect fish and shellfish from six coastal locations, two lake or reservoir locations, and two river locations within the San Diego Region (Figure 1, Table 1).

**LEFT OFF HERE!! Next - figure out structure of Appendix 1**

\[A1 Caption - Appendix 1. Analytes included in the 2019 lakes sampling, detection limits, number of observations, and frequencies of detection and reporting.\]

Analytes (e.g., Mercury, PFAS) included in the sample, detection limits, as well as numbers of observations and frequencies of detection and reporting, are provided in Appendix 1. All concentrations are reported on a wet weight basis. Moisture data are available, along with the entire dataset, via the [California Environmental Data Exchange Network](http://www.ceden.org/) (CEDEN).

## Data Management

The complete dataset for this study includes quality assurance data (quality control samples and field duplicates) and additional ancillary information (specific location information, fish sex, weights, and other information). The complete dataset is available via [CEDEN](http://www.ceden.org/find_data_page.shtml). The data are also available through...

## Statistical Methods

The measurement of mercury in individual black bass samples provided a foundation for statistical procedures to adjust for the relationship with fish length. A length of 350 mm has been used for length-adjustment of black bass in past studies (e.g., Davis et al. 2008, Melwani et al. 2009, Davis et al. 2010), and represents the middle of the distribution of legal-sized (\>305 mm, or 12 inches) fish that are commonly caught.

Estimates of length-adjusted means presented for the results in this report are based on simple linear regressions of the data for each location. This approach provides an independently-derived estimate of the location mean that can be compared to any other location mean of interest: other location means from the same sampling period; means from the same location in past sampling; or any other location mean of interest. Length-adjusted means prior to 2015 were calculated slightly differently, with the results for multiple lakes pooled for the analysis of covariance (Davis et al. 2018).

For the paragraph below this callout:

Do we want to try developing these tables and posting them on the Open Data Portal and linking to them from here instead of or in addition to providing them as an appendix? I am thinking that if folks want to look at the data themselves, it would be much easier to do so via a csv or xlsx rather via this PDF.
:::

A concise tabular summary of the data for each sampling location is provided in Appendix 1. Data for mercury analyses on individual fish are provided in Appendix 2. Data for PFAS analyses are provided in Appendix 3.

Largemouth bass was the primary sport fish species sampled, with 663 fish collected from 36 lakes. The two other black bass species were collected at fewer lakes: 69 spotted bass were collected from four lakes, and 32 smallmouth bass were collected from one lake. Common carp (90 fish from 12 locations) and redear sunfish (59 fish from seven lakes) were the next most widely sampled species after largemouth bass.

Small prey fish were also sampled. A total of 1436 prey fish representing 15 species were collected from the 41 lakes (Figure 2, Table 2b). A concise tabulated summary of the data for each lake is provided in Appendix 2b. The most commonly sampled prey fish species were bluegill (454 fish from 33 locations) and young largemouth bass (408 fish from 29 locations).

## Mercury

::: callout-important
In the lakes report, figures and tables are provided at the end of the report - here I would like to incorporate them into the report, alongside relevant text.

If tables are too long to do that nicely, let's make them an appendix.

## Organic Contaminants

PCBs were analyzed in 23 composite samples from 14 lakes. Seven different species were analyzed. The reported result was not detected (ND) for all the samples.

Legacy pesticides were analyzed in 12 samples, with all ND for dieldrin and sum of chlordanes, and two detections for sum of DDTs: 29 ppb in a common carp sample from Puddingstone Reservoir and 8 ppb in a common carp sample from Legg Lake.

## Selenium

Selenium was measured primarily so that future risk assessments can consider risks due to combined exposure to mercury and selenium. However, some samples had concentrations at low levels of concern relative to OEHHA advisory tissue levels (ATLs).

Selenium concentrations were measured in 109 composite samples of sport fish. Concentrations ranged from a minimum of 0.12 ppm to a maximum of 4.21 ppm, with a median of 0.27 ppm. The lowest OEHHA ATL for selenium is 1.0 ppm, with recommended consumption of six or fewer servings per week associated with concentrations above this level. Twelve of the 109 samples (11%) had concentrations above 1.0 ppm. The two highest concentrations were observed in samples from Loveland Reservoir (4.21 ppm) and Lake Casitas (4.19 ppm).

Selenium concentrations were measured in 144 composite samples of prey fish. Concentrations ranged from a minimum of 0.12 ppm to a maximum of 5.42 ppm, with a median of 0.31 ppm. The highest concentration was observed in Lake Casitas: a largemouth bass composite at 5.42 ppm.

Note: water samples were collected at all freshwater locations (n=4; collected by MPSL) and those coastal sites where oysters and/or mussels were collected (n=tbd; collected by R9 SWAMP).

# Discussion and Next Steps

Add text...

-   summarizing big picture findings and monitoring/analysis lessons learned from this Realignment process,
-   how the Region will use the data to inform TBUs, IR, and anything else
-   future monitoring already in the works or under consideration, based on needs and priorities identified by the committee
-   how folks can contribute to or stay informed of future statewide and/or regional monitoring efforts
