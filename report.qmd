# Introduction

This document presents a data report for monitoring that took place in 2022/2023 as part of the SWAMP Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program Realignment in the San Diego Region (R9).

# Methods

A detailed description of the methods for sample collection and chemical analysis is provided in the [Monitoring and Analysis Workplan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/bioaccumulationprogram-realignment-monitoringanalysisworkplan-r9-20211216.pdf) (Monitoring Plan; Dec 2021). The methods are briefly summarized here, with a focus on information specific to the 2022/23 San Deigo Region Realignment effort.

## Sample Collection

The Monitoring Plan called for collection of fish and shellfish from XX lake or reservoir locations, XX river locations, and XX coastal locations in 2022. XX of these locations were prioritized and were successfully sampled in 2022 (Figure 1). Details of sample collection are provided in the [Cruise Report](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring/docs/2023/BioaccumulationProgram_Realignment_CruiseReport_R9_20230307.pdf) (Mar 2023).

## Sample Preparation and Analytical Methods

Samples were processed and distributed to the analytical laboratories as described in the Monitoring Plan by personnel at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Moss Landing, CA.

Mercury and selenium were analyzed by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Mercury and selenium were analyzed following the method presented in the Monitoring Plan.

PCBs and legacy pesticides were analyzed by Babcock and SGS-Axys (LOCATION). Organochlorine pesticides were analyzed according to USEPA Method 8081A, "Organochlorine Pesticides by Gas Chromatography." PCBs were analyzed according to USEPA Method 8082, "Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) by Gas Chromatography."

Analytes included in the monitoring, detection limits, as well as numbers of observations and frequencies of detection and reporting, are provided in Table 1. All concentrations are reported on a wet weight basis. Moisture data are available, along with the entire dataset, via the [California Environmental Data Exchange Network](http://www.ceden.org/) (CEDEN).

## Data Management

The complete dataset for this study includes quality assurance data (quality control samples and field duplicates) and additional ancillary information (specific location information, fish sex, weights, and other information). The complete dataset is available via [CEDEN](http://www.ceden.org/find_data_page.shtml). The data are also available through...

## Statistical Methods

The measurement of mercury in individual black bass samples provided a foundation for statistical procedures to adjust for the relationship with fish length. A length of 350 mm has been used for length-adjustment of black bass in past studies (e.g., Davis et al. 2008, Melwani et al. 2009, Davis et al. 2010), and represents the middle of the distribution of legal-sized (\>305 mm, or 12 inches) fish that are commonly caught.

Estimates of length-adjusted means presented for the results in this report are based on simple linear regressions of the data for each location. This approach provides an independently-derived estimate of the location mean that can be compared to any other location mean of interest: other location means from the same sampling period; means from the same location in past sampling; or any other location mean of interest. Length-adjusted means prior to 2015 were calculated slightly differently, with the results for multiple lakes pooled for the analysis of covariance (Davis et al. 2018).

# Results

## Summary of Fish Collected
